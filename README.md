## Linting

This project uses ESLint with Next.js configuration. Run linting with:

```bash
pnpm lint          # Check for linting issues
pnpm lint:fix      # Auto-fix auto-fixable issues
```

The linting configuration enforces TypeScript best practices, React rules, and Next.js optimizations while keeping most issues as warnings (temporarily) to avoid blocking development.

## Git Hooks

This project automatically runs linting checks before each commit using `simple-git-hooks`. This is enabled automatically when you run `pnpm install`. If you need to enable it manually:

```bash
npx simple-git-hooks
```

If linting fails, the commit will be blocked until issues are resolved.
